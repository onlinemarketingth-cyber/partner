/**
 * TASK-161 §3.2 / §5 — business logic for company colour presets.
 *
 * BR-7: this class holds NO colour values. `COLOR_FIELDS` is a list of
 * COLUMN NAMES, not a palette — every actual hex comes from the company's
 * own `company_theme_settings` row (or, where that row has no opinion,
 * from ThemeService::defaults(), which is the platform's existing neutral
 * fallback and not a new invention). Designed starter palettes
 * ("โทนทอง", "โทนน้ำเงิน", …) remain BR-7 values that must come from the
 * human — §5.1 was approved precisely BECAUSE it copies what already
 * exists rather than choosing anything.
 *
 * §5/BR-6: `company_id` is always keyed from the passed Company / the
 * preset's own row, never from request input.
 *
 * TASK-164 amends the BR-7 note above in ONE respect: designed starter
 * palettes now exist, because the human supplied them (via ag-lead,
 * 2026-08-11) — which is exactly the condition TASK-161 §5.1 set. They
 * still are not held here. They live in `config/theme_presets.php`, which
 * is seed data a non-developer can be pointed at; this class reads that
 * file and writes rows, and continues to hold no colour of its own.
