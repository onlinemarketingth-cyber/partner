/**
 * 2026-09-16 — WHEN A SUPPLIER'S MONEY BECOMES WITHDRAWABLE.
 *
 * Owner: "ตามแต่ละดีล Setup ได้" — so this is a term of the deal, per
 * supplier, not one rule for the platform.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DOES *NOT* CONTROL ──
 *
 * It does not decide whether the ledger row exists. The row is written the
 * moment the order is paid, always, whatever this says, because the sale has
 * happened and accounting has to be able to see what we owe from that instant.
 * This enum sets `released_at` and nothing else.
 *
 * Writing the row late would mean a payables figure that is only correct once
 * every outstanding parcel has been delivered — a number nobody could
 * reconcile on any given day.
 *
 * ── WHO CARRIES THE RISK ──
 *
 * The three cases are a risk dial, and it points at us:
 *
 *   OnPayment   we may pay the supplier before they have delivered anything.
 *               If the customer then refunds, we are out of pocket and have
 *               to ask for it back.
 *   OnRedeemed  the customer has turned up and taken the service.
 *   OnDelivered the parcel has gone.
 *
 * The last two are the safe ones; the first exists because some suppliers
 * will not agree to anything else.
