/**
 * MyTeamView — TASK-109 / ADR-024. The team leader's monitoring screen.
 *
 * READ-ONLY BY CONSTRUCTION (ADR-024 §7). There is deliberately no edit,
 * advance-stage, grant-certification or mark-paid control anywhere in this
 * file, and the only verbs it issues are GETs. That is not merely a UI
 * choice: `/me/team` exposes no write route at all, so a button here would
 * have nothing to call. Anyone adding one must go back to ADR-024 first.
 *
 * WHAT IT SHOWS
 *  - Header KPIs rolled up over the leader's WHOLE subtree (the API does
 *    that rollup; this view never sums a tree client-side).
 *  - A vertically nested list of the downline, expanded ONE LEVEL AT A TIME
 *    (ADR-024 §3) — the deeper levels are fetched only when a leader asks
 *    for them, so a wide organisation costs one request per node opened
 *    instead of one enormous tree on load.
 *  - A per-member client drill-down, gated server-side by the company's
 *    configured visibility level (ADR-024 §5).
 *
 * BR-3 — every money figure crossing the wire is an INTEGER in satang. The
 * division by 100 happens in formatBaht() and nowhere else, at render time.
 * No arithmetic in this file ever produces a fractional baht value.
 *
 * BR-4 — the three money figures per member (sales / their commission / my
 * override from them) are READ from the commission ledger by the API. This
 * view never recomputes, re-rates or re-totals a commission.
 *
 * ADR-023 — colours come from the surface/ink/line token layer only. No
 * `text-slate-*`, `text-white` or `bg-white` appears below.
 *
 * ADR-021 — on a phone HeroHeader publishes its identity row into the app
 * top bar and renders only the tabs row here, so this screen spends ~45px
 * of the 15% header budget. See the mobile summary card in the body for
 * why the KPIs are also repeated there.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * TASK-116 / ADR-025 — THE ONE WRITE SURFACE ON THIS SCREEN.
 *
 * The read-only rule above still governs everything about CLIENT AND SALES
 * data. ADR-025 §7 carves out exactly one exception, and this file now
 * carries it: a designated team leader may mint/revoke their own recruit
 * links and admit their own pending recruits into the company. Nothing else
 * became writable — there is still no edit, advance-stage, grant-cert or
 * mark-paid control anywhere below, and the recruit endpoints touch only
 * `agent_invite_links` and the recruit's own `agent_approval_status`.
 *
 * THE DISTINCTION THAT DRIVES THE WHOLE GATE (ADR-025 §2) — two capabilities
 * that look alike and are deliberately NOT merged:
 *
 *   `isLeader`      (from GET /me/team) = "I have direct reports".
 *                   Gates the MONITOR: the tabs, the roster, the KPIs.
 *   `isTeamLeader`  (from /me → users.is_team_leader) = "an admin designated
 *                   me a team leader". Gates RECRUITING: the "ชวนเข้าทีม"
 *                   action, the links list, the approval queue.
 *
 * They disagree in both directions, and both disagreements are intentional:
 *   • Flag but no reports — a brand-new leader who has not recruited anyone
 *     yet. They MUST still see the invite affordance, otherwise the feature
 *     is unreachable for exactly the person it was granted to. This is why
 *     the recruit block sits OUTSIDE the `v-else-if="!isLeader"` branch
 *     below rather than inside the roster.
 *   • Reports but no flag — an ex-leader, or a manager an admin never
 *     flagged. They keep their monitor and get no recruiting controls.
 * Gating both on one boolean would silently break one of those two people.
 *
 * The flag is a UI affordance only. Every action it reveals is re-authorised
 * server-side (AgentInviteLinkService's is_team_leader guard →  422,
 * UserPolicy::approveRegistration → 403), so a tampered store buys nothing;
 * see the 403 handling in loadRecruitData().
